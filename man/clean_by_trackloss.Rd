\title{Clean data by removing high-trackloss trials/subjects.}
\usage{
clean_by_trackloss(data, participant_prop_thresh = 1, trial_prop_thresh = 1,
  window_start_time = -Inf, window_end_time = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data already run through \code{make_eyetrackingr_data}}

\item{participant_prop_thresh}{Maximum proportion of trackloss for participants}

\item{trial_prop_thresh}{Maximum proportion of trackloss for trials}

\item{window_start_time, window_end_time}{Time-window within which you want trackloss analysis to
be based. Allows you to keep the entire trial window for data, but clean based on the trackloss
within a subset of it}
}
\value{
Cleaned data
}
\description{
Remove trials/participants with too much trackloss, with a customizable threshold.
